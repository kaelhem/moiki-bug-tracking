This repository allows to list bugs encountered on [Moiki](https://moiki.fr/en).

## I don't know GitHub, but I would like to report a problem
First of all, you have to create an account.
Then you just have to go to the [issues](https://github.com/kaelhem/moiki-bug-tracking/issues) page and click on the _New issue_ button.

## How to report a bug
Firstly, make sure that the bug in question does not already exist in the list of _issues_. If it is already there and you have additional information to provide to help solve it, say so in a comment.

In order to facilitate the correction of the bug encountered, it is strongly advised to provide this information:
+ detailed description of the problem (and possibly the reproduction scenario if necessary)
+ page/component concerned (editor, player, ...)
+ browser/OS where the problem is reproduced (and possibly versions)

Please also add a screenshot if the bug is difficult to describe.
