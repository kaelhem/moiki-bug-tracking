# v0.8.29

### [fix - editor]
+ Fixed a long-standing issue that could prevent certain modals from opening when the sequence text editor had focus. This fix should significantly improve the user experience.  
+ Fixed an issue in the history module where some saves might not have been recorded.  
+ Fixed an issue where some icons did not respect the monochrome style (also fixed in the player).

### [fix - site]
+ Fixed the link to edit the publication settings of a story added to the Social Club.

### [improvements]
+ Password fields now have an option to display their content in plain text.  
+ Added a button in the story deletion confirmation dialog to copy the story name (to make deletion easier).
